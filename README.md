# Stanford-CS229
Andrew Ng's CS229 course materials (Autumn 2017) - http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

I store all the course materials of Stanford CS229 for Autumn 2017, which include (i) class notes, (ii) discussion section notes, (iii) supplementary notes, (iv) problem sets (including datasets, starter codes), and (v) my own (non-official) solution to problem sets.

Roughly speaking, I put them in different folders in the following way:
Assignments - contains (iv) problem sets, and (v) my own solution;
Lecture Notes - contains (i) class notes;
Tutorial Notes - contains (ii) discussion section notes, and (iii) supplementary notes.
